# general instructions

1. you are updating code to an existing module
2. the module exports api via index.mjs and exposes a cli tool via cli.mjs (installed via npm i -g commitai)

# new features

1. an onboarding process as part of the cli tool:
	a. ask the user to select a provider
	b. ask the user to provide an api key for the previous selected provider
	c. ask the user to select a model
		- if the provider has an api endpoint for listing the models, fetch a list and let the user select from it
		- also allow the user to provide a custom/manual model name
	d. the config file should be updated with the onboarding results and saved in ~/.config/commitai
	e. if the file exists, confirm with the user it will be overwritten before writing the new file.

2. automatically combine the output of git status and git diff as part of the gen command:
	- stdin functionality should still be available but the user will have to specify --stdin option
